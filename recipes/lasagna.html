    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
        This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Bell peppers</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>A combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
